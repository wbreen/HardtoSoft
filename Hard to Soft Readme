Hard to Soft:


Requirements:

Phone app that takes at least 1 picture of the photograph

	2 options for what it does next:
		1. Save the image to the disk, and do all the merging into one later
		2. Do the image processing and cut out the picture on device

Phone app then sends signal to Arduino that the picture has been taken and can move the robot onto the next photograph to take the picture of


Research topics:
	-How to combine images into one, and if it is possible to increase resolution by doing this
	-communicating between an Android app and the Arduino
	-Image processing on the phone vs sending to a computer to do the image combinations
